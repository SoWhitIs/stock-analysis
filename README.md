# Going Green! (Renewable Energy Stock Analysis)

## Overview of Project

Helping client, Steve, _"Go, green!"_, by creating an efficient workspace that would ultimately compare renewable energy stock standings from 2017 to 2018, respectively. This workflow was created by automating frequent tasks as data pulling, filtering, clean-up, and permutation through Marco-coded --_scripts_--VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programing, to which could be used similarly in later applications with larger datasets. 

Having this access to this data at the push of a but…_Marco_ button helps Steve see at glance what stocks would make for better investment opportunities to diversify his parent portfolio.

## Results

### Analysis 

Initially, Steve’s parents were set on investing all their money in DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company manufacturing silicon wafers for solar panels, for reasons none other than they met at a Dairy Queen — **DQ**, coincidentally, is the company’s ticker.

However, upon deeper analysis we saw company **DAQO** or **DQ** had an over 60% profit loss in 2018, after an near 200 percent profit margin gain in 2017.

In doing another analysis, noticeably 11 out 12 stocks fared significantly well in 2017, with 1 stock saw a minor loss of roughly 8 points (percentage) even with a daily volume of 100K (**TERP**). 

Yet, in 2018, **two** out of the 12 tickers (stocks) experienced profit gains, (**ENPH**, **RUN**).

So, that leaves us with the question: *What *stocks* would make for the better investment?* 

While such a decision would ultimately be that of the client, we can provide resources and tools that would aid in the decision-making process. 

*  Possible Recommendations
 
     * **ENPH**, *Steady Profits in 2017, 2018*
     * **RUN**,  *Steady Profits in 2017, 2018*
     
     * **VSLR**, *Least Amount of Profit Loss, in 2018*


## Summary

### To Refract _or_ Not Refract

Coding, without a doubt, can elevate the most mundane of task to that of efficiency and ingenuity. It is a process of “getting there”…*just* like a story there is two sides, writing the code …and debugging the code! (Well, there’s three…the type of language or program used to write said code, will explain more in next section.)

This process of editing and debugging code to find what does and does not work in called _refactoring_.  This brings forth challenges in and of itself, namely because the goal is to have clean, “easy” readable (and editable) code that is both accessible to you and the client—how that is not always the case—and finding what went wrong can take just as long as actually writing the code initially. 

On the other hand, refactoring code does not mean *having* to start over often, (though it is good practice to start combing through from the top), for what is presented is a _template of sorts_ customizable to needs. 

### VBA Scripting

Debugging! Debugging! Debugging! As mentioned in previous section are challenges in coding can come from the type of language or the systems used to create this code like VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). 

VBA is a powerful programming tool that is native to Microsoft Office and can be used across their products from extracting data to generate an e-mail through Marcos.  Marcos are amazing containers of information, and when understanding how VBA functions and performs can present endless opportunities, especially when analyzing data.

Refactoring code in VBA Script in Excel allows you to run your code and debug (which can often take as long as the writing the code) within and module interface and in turn see those result on an assigned or activate spreadsheet—this provides a real-time snapshot of your code. Thankful for this code can be saved as a module to access at any time.  A true benefit of this ecosystem is that you can compare code and/or scripts simultaneously assign buttons, or like active controls.

While it can be accessed at any time, often refactoring VBA Script cause issues that is not necessarily clear or the root cause is not apparent. A Marco that ran perfectly in one application, or a few moments now prompts Runtime errors like the one seen below.

In this particular analysis, VBA script refactoring was done to address several needs of the client. Fortunately, much of the same code from the original script was applicable but editing made the script in this particular use case added flexibility and streamlined data comparisons.
