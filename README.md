# Going Green! (Renewable Energy Analysis)

## Overview of Project

Helping client, Steve, _go green_, by creating an efficient workspace that would ultimately compare renewable energy stock standings from 2017 to 2018, respectively. This workflow was created by automating frequent tasks as data pulling, filtering, clean-up, and permutation through Marco-coded --_scripts_--VBA programing, to which could be used similarly in later applications with larger datasets. 
Having this access to this data at the push of a but…_Marco button_ helps Steve see at glance what stocks would make for better investment opportunities to diversify his parent portfolio.

## Results

### Analysis 

Initially Steve’s parents were set on investing all their money in DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company manufacturing silicon wafers for solar panels for reasons simply that they met at DQ (Dairy Queen)—*DQ* is the company’s ticker. 
However, upon deeper analysis we saw company *DAQO* or *DQ* had an over 60% profit loss in 2018, after an almost 200 percent profit margin in 2017.

In doing another analysis, noticeably 11 out 12 stocks fared significantly well in 2017, with 1 stock saw a minor loss of roughly 8 points (percentage) even with a daily volume of 100K (*TERP*).

Yet, in 2018, *two* out of the 12 tickers (stocks), experienced profit gains, (*ENPH* * *RUN*).

So, that leaves us with *What *stocks* would make for the better investment?* 

While such a decision would ultimately be that of the client, we can provide resources and tools that would aiding in that decision-making process.

## Summary

### To Refract _or_ Not Refract
Coding, without a doubt can elevate the most mundane of task to that of efficiency and ingenuity. It is a process of “getting there”…_just_ like a story there is two sides, writing the code …and debugging the code! (Well, there’s three…the type of language used to write said code, will explain more in next section.
This process of editing and debugging code to find what does and does not work in called _refactoring_.  This present challenges in and of itself, namely because the goal is to have clean, “easy” readable (and editable) code that is both accessible to you and the client—how that is not always the case—and finding what went wrong can take just as long as actually writing the code initially. 
On the other hand, refactoring code does not mean *having* to start over often, (though it is good practice to start combing through from the top), for what is presented is a _template of sorts_ that can be customized to needs. 

### VBA Scripting
Debugging! Debugging! Debugging! As mentioned in previous section challenges in coding can come from the type of language or the systems used to create this code like VBA (Visual Basic Application). 
VBA is a powerful programming tool that is native to Microsoft Office and can be used across their products from extracting data to generate an e-mail through Marcos.  Marcos are amazing containers of information when understanding how VBA functions and performs can present endless opportunities.

Refactoring code in VBA Script in Excel allows you to run your code and debug within and module interface and in turn see those result on an assigned or activate spreadsheet—this provides a real-time snapshot of your code. Thank you for this code can be save as module to access at any time.  A true benefit in this ecosystem is that you can compare code and/or scripts simultaneously assign buttons, or like active controls. 

Insert multiple modules

While it can be access at any time, often refactoring VBA Script cause issues that is not necessarily clear or the root cause is not apparent. A Marco that ran perfectly in one application, or a few moments now prompts Runtime errors like the one seen below.
